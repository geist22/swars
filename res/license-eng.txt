All source code except the code in src/*.sx is licensed under the GNU
General Public License, version 3 or any later version.  src/*.sx files are
modified disassembled version of the original game's main.exe by Bullfrog.  The
project is distributed without charge and in good faith that it will be useful
to those who purchased the original game but cannot play it anymore because
they do not have access to an old DOS system.  However, should the original
copyright holders complain, we will take down the code they have the rights to.
If that happens, please stop distribution of this bundle.
